# Dynalist Hacks

This contains some tools for dealing with Dynalist. Right now it's a half-baked
Python library for interacting with their API, plus a script that copies my
daily review template into the appropriate place and gives it a date.

I'll run this once a day as a Google Cloud Platform "Cloud Function" to avoid
needing to run my own server.
